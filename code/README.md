# Notebooks

There is one notebook dedicated to collect and analyse data. Further, each model trained has its own notebook.

On training notebooks it can found the logical sequence below:
1. Load libraries and Data
2. Select and apply treatment to feature group
3. Training a basic model with standard hyperparameters
4. Training and select model base on best performance over test set
5. Hyper tuning model

Models tested:
- Linear Regression 
- Support Vector Machine
- LightGBM
- Multi Layer Perceptron
- Recurrent Neural Network
